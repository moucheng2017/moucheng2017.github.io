I am an AI researcher and engineer. My work on <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841524000501'>Bayesian Pseudo Labels</a> was named a finalist for the Young Scientist Award (Best Paper) at <a href='https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/papers/066-Paper2505.html'>MICCAI 2022</a> (top 0.8%, 15 / 1835 submissions). I developed Olympus Corporation's SmartIBD, a regulator-approved AI product for endoscopy that was featured in the <a href='https://www.olympus-global.com/news/2024/nr02759.html'>media</a>. My main research interest focuses on developing end-to-end deep learning models to learn from medical data, brining fairer, better and safer healthcare to the patients.

Priorly, I obtained my PhD in medical image computing from University College London, under the supervisions of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XCcV5ocAAAAJ&hl=en'>Joseph Jacob</a>, <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mH-ZOQEAAAAJ&hl=en'>Daniel C.
