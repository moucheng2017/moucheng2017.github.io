I am a researcher in medical AI industry. My work was named a finalist for the Young Scientist Award (Best Paper) at MICCAI 2022 (top 0.8%, 15 / 1835 submissions). My work has also resulted in a regulator-approved product, featured in the <a href='https://www.olympus-global.com/news/2024/nr02759.html'>media</a>. My main research interest focuses on developing end-to-end models to learn from medical data, brining better and safer healthcare to the patients. 

Prior to that, I obtained my PhD in medical image computing from University College London, under the supervisions of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XCcV5ocAAAAJ&hl=en'>Joseph Jacob</a>, <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mH-ZOQEAAAAJ&hl=en'>Daniel C.
